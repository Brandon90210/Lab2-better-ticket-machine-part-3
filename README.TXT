Start of part 3 :)

47: The error states to use a positive number and not 0, No the balance remains
the same.

48: I believe that an error message will be shown, There was no error message and the balance was reset to 0 despite
previously inserting money.

50: It was the visibility of the canvas, yes it was well suited as there were only 2 options

52: It is possible as the code compiles, It asks me to insert money.

53: Yes because if you insert more than the ticket price it will be seen as extra to remove.

58: I believe that the > version is easier as it is either enough to pay or not while the >= method can be the exact value

59: Because the name has been set to refundBalance

60: it says that there is an unreachable statement and so it will not compile as it is in the wrong order

61: In the actual source code version it is written price and not int price, it does compile, the values are all
set to 0 due to the int

64: A new method would need to be added in order to obtain the half price option and a return statement would need to be
added for it to return to the original price.
